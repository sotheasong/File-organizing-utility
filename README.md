# File-organizing-utility

Designed and implemented a file organization utility in Java that automates the
categorization and relocation of files based on their types. The utility scans a
specified source directory, identifies file types through extensions, and efficiently
moves them to designated destination directories using:
- Automated Categorization: Developed logic to automatically categorize files into distinct
groups, including audio, image, document, and miscellaneous files.
- Multithreaded File Movement: Implemented multithreading to enhance the efficiency of
file copying operations, improving overall program performance.
- Exception Handling: Incorporated robust exception handling mechanisms to address
potential issues during file I/O operations, ensuring the program's reliability and
stability.
- Source and Destination Directories: Configured the utility to work with customizable
source and destination directories, providing flexibility for different use cases.
